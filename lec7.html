1. What are the generic font families? Explain in details with examples
• Serif: Fonts with small decorative lines at the end of characters. Common examples
include Times New Roman, Georgia, and Garamond.
• Sans-serif: Fonts without the decorative lines. Examples include Arial, Helvetica, and
Verdana.
• Monospace: Characters have a fixed width, suitable for code. Examples include Courier
New, Monaco, and Consolas.
• Cursive: Fonts that simulate handwriting. Examples include Comic Sans MS, cursive.
• Fantasy: Decorative fonts with artistic flair. Examples include Impact, fantasy.
2. It is recommended to use each family of generic fonts in fallback style. Why?
It's recommended to use generic font families in fallback style because specific fonts may not
be available on all devices. If a user doesn't have the specified font installed, the browser will
fall back to the generic font family, ensuring a consistent and readable experience.
Example:-->
body {
 font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
}
3. How can you insert Hoverable Table by CSS? Show me by code.
To make a table row hoverable, you can use the :hover pseudo-class in CSS. Here's an example:
table {
 border-collapse: collapse;
 width: 100%;
}
table, th, td {
 border: 1px solid black;
}
tr:hover {
 background-color: #f5f5f5;
}
4. Insert list markers by CSS, once outside the border and another inside it, as shown below
ul {
 list-style-position: outside;
 border: 2px solid #333;
 padding: 10px;
}
li {
 margin: 5px 0;
}
ul {
 list-style-position: inside;
 border: 2px solid #333;
 padding: 10px;
}
li {
 margin: 5px 0;
}
